## Important Note!
   1- Due to time constraints, I could not add to much styling to page but i have implementec all functionalities mentioned by you in the assignment.<br/>
   2- This project is hoisted on [Project Link](https://polymath-ai-project.vercel.app/) but due to constraints of News API to work only in developers mode you might not be able access news page on hoisted application and might face security error.
